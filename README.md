## 📅 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1 – Filesystem Navigation
I reviewed Linux navigation commands and learned how the filesystem is structured. Using tools like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `find`, I moved through directories efficiently and located files with ease.

### Day 2 – File Permissions & Ownership
I explored how Linux permissions work and how symbolic (`rwx`) and numeric (`755`) modes correspond. I practiced using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`, gaining a clear understanding of Linux access control and system security.

### Day 3 – Text Processing & Pipelines
I worked with tools like `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, and pipes (`|`). These tools demonstrated the power of the command line for processing large text files.  
**Highlight:** An email extraction task showed how a short pipeline can solve real-world data problems quickly.

### Day 4 – Process & Resource Management
I learned how Linux handles running processes. I created and stopped a runaway process to understand PIDs, CPU usage, memory consumption, and system limits. Tools like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, and `kill` became straightforward to use.

### Day 5 – SSH & Secure File Transfer
I learned how to connect to remote servers securely using SSH (Secure Shell) and how to transfer files using `scp`.  
Using a Windows machine as the client and Ubuntu as the server, I generated SSH key pairs, verified network connectivity, and practiced secure remote management.

## Weekly Reflection

On Day 1, I reviewed basic navigation commands and learned how the Linux filesystem works. I moved through directories faster and found files with less effort.
On Day 2, I focused on file permissions. I learned how symbolic and numeric modes match and how to change ownership and access with chmod. This helped me understand system security in a practical way.
On Day 3, I used text-processing tools like grep, awk, and pipelines. These tools showed me how powerful the command line is when working with large files. The email-extraction task proved how a few commands can solve real problems.
On Day 4, I explored how Linux handles running processes. Creating and stopping a runaway process helped me understand PIDs, CPU usage, and resource limits. Tools like top and htop now feel easy to use.
On Day 5, I learned how to connect to remote servers with SSH. I generated key pairs and used scp to move files securely. The log-analysis task brought all the skills together and helped me build an efficient workflow.
Overall, this week gave me useful knowledge and a more practical way of thinking when I troubleshoot or work on the command line.
