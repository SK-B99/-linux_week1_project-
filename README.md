## 📅 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1 – Filesystem Navigation
I reviewed Linux navigation commands and learned how the filesystem is structured. Using tools like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `find`, I moved through directories efficiently and located files with ease.

### Day 2 – File Permissions & Ownership
I explored how Linux permissions work and how symbolic (`rwx`) and numeric (`755`) modes correspond. I practiced using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`, gaining a clear understanding of Linux access control and system security.

### Day 3 – Text Processing & Pipelines
I worked with tools like `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, and pipes (`|`). These tools demonstrated the power of the command line for processing large text files.  
**Highlight:** An email extraction task showed how a short pipeline can solve real-world data problems quickly.

### Day 4 – Process & Resource Management
I learned how Linux handles running processes. I created and stopped a runaway process to understand PIDs, CPU usage, memory consumption, and system limits. Tools like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, and `kill` became straightforward to use.

### Day 5 – SSH & Secure File Transfer
I learned how to connect to remote servers securely using SSH (Secure Shell) and how to transfer files using `scp`.  
Using a Windows machine as the client and Ubuntu as the server, I generated SSH key pairs, verified network connectivity, and practiced secure remote management.

## Lessons Learned

Over the past five days, I have built a strong foundation in Linux. I can perform key tasks confidently and efficiently.  

## Filesystem Navigation
- I can navigate the filesystem easily using `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `find`.
- I  understand and I can explore the Linux directory structure.

## File Permissions and Ownership
- I can manage file permissions and ownership.
- I can read and set symbolic modes using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.

## Text Processing
- I can extract and manipulate data using `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, and pipes.
- I can solve real problems quickly with these tools.

## Process Monitoring and Control
- I can monitor system processes using `top` and `htop`.
- I can identify runaway tasks and stop them safely.

## Secure Remote Access
- I can generate SSH keys and connect from server to client securely.
- I can transfer files safely using `scp`.
